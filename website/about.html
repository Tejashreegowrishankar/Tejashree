        <h2>This is TEJASHREE GOWRISHANKAR.Currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology. I have a cgpa of 8.3 till my sixth semester. My short term goal is to get placed in a well reputed company. My hobbies are cooking and listening songs. I hope to become a software engineer or web developer shortly. Still, right now, Iâ€™m just enjoying my time studying and learning new things every day! One thing that sets me apart from other students is my ability to take on multiple projects simultaneously. In addition to being an active member of these clubs and organizations, I also participate in many volunteer opportunities during our school year. One of my favorite things about school is learning different topics through hands-on experience. 
        I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</h2>
